          Hello! I'm Alan Varghese Paul, currently pursuing B. Tech in Computer
          Science and Engineering at SCMS School of Engineering and Technology
          (SSET), Kerala, India. Iâ€™m a passionate and creative web developer
          with a strong love for crafting engaging and user-friendly websites. I
          have a strong foundation in front-end and back-end development, and I
          thrive on turning innovative ideas into functional, beautiful, and
          intuitive digital experiences. <br />
          <br /> My journey as a web developer began during my college years. I
          constantly seek to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the
          latest trends and technologies in the fast-paced world of web
          development.
          <br /> <br /> Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I look forward to
          creating innovative web solutions together.
